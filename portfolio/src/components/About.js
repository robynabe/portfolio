          <section className='about-overview'>
              <p>Hello! I am Robyn Abe and here is my story.</p>
              <p>At the beginning of 2020 I stumbled across an online seminar hosted by SheCodes all while searching for my next 
                career move. They were promoting women in code and I found this to be inspiring. I was overly intrigued by this 
                field that I had never given a thought to in the past, so I took a chance and signed up for the 4 month React workshop. 
                I found passion in the frustrating excitment of making a website application come to life both funcationally and through design. 
                I decided to attend an accredited school and take this new career path more seriously. 
                From there I enrolled in the Technical Web Design program at BCIT (currently named Front-End Web Developer).
              </p>
              <p>I realized I love to develop and express my creativity digitally. I enjoy creating the small details that bring a website 
                together and I use lazy perfectionism to my advantage. I find the quickest, yet most efficent way to get
                something done without sacrificing the quality of the final product. I take much pride in the projects that 
                I have completed so far in the short period of time that I have been in this field. I am anxious to get 
                started and be a part of a new community!
              </p>
